# Log Parsing and Processing
This Java project provides a solution to parse and process log lines with different log levels. It includes functionality to handle multiple log levels, parse and transform log lines, and generate a compressed log format.

## Project Overview

[<LEVEL>]: <MESSAGE>

### Supported log levels include:

Additionally, the project handles unknown log levels and can output logs in a compressed format with numeric encoding for log levels.
